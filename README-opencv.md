# OpenCV build hints from the time before the SIFT patent had expired.

Well, every time I look, opencv/fedora changes how things are packaged.  The
current state (Dec 04, 2018) is that we have to build ourselves from source code
in order to get access to the SIFT functionality.  Another year and a half a the
SIFT patent expires, maybe it can become part of the base opencv at that point?

Fedora installation tips

  hdf5-devel gflags-devel glog-devel tesseract-devel vtk-devel
* ? gtk2-devel ?

## recommended packages

* dnf install libpng-devel libjpeg-turbo-devel jasper-devel openexr-devel

## extract

```bash
$ cd into source tree
```

## contrib modules

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib.git
$ cd opencv_contrib
$ git checkout X.Y.Z (version matches the opencv version we are building)

$ cd back to opencv-X.Y.Z
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DWITH_TBB=ON -DWITH_EIGEN=ON -DOPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=../../opencv_contrib/modules -DOPENCV_ENABLE_NONFREE=ON -DPYTHON_DEFAULT_EXECUTABLE=python3 ..
```

## build it:

```bash
$ make -j4
```

## install it

```bash
$ sudo make install
```

## Make it accessible to yourself by adding this to your ~/.bashrc file:

(and if you run [t]csh or something else you probably already know how to do the
equivalent in your own shell.)

```bash
# User specific aliases and functions
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/python/cv2/python-3.7
```
